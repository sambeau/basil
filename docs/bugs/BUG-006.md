# BUG-006: Images break after live reload

## Summary
Images appear broken after live reload triggers, especially on startup or after recovering from an error page.

## Observed Behavior
- Start Basil → images break
- Make non-breaking change → images work  
- Code error shows error page → fix code → images break
- Manual browser refresh → images work
- Second code change after fix → images work

## Expected Behavior
Images should load correctly after every live reload trigger.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Create a Parsley project with images on the page
2. Start Basil in dev mode
3. Open browser to the page
4. Observe images may be broken on first load
5. Make a code change to trigger reload
6. Images may break again

## Environment
- OS: macOS
- Go version: 1.24+
- Basil version: v0.2.0

## Investigation Notes

### Root Cause
The live reload script started polling immediately when injected, without waiting for the page to fully load. This caused a race condition:

1. HTML parses, live reload script starts
2. First poll captures `lastSeq = N`
3. Browser starts loading images
4. If file changes occur, `seq` becomes `N+1`
5. Next poll sees `seq !== lastSeq`, triggers `location.reload()`
6. **Reload aborts in-flight image requests**
7. Images appear broken

The pattern where "second change works" is explained by browser caching - after images load successfully once, they load from cache instantly on subsequent reloads.

### Affected Code
- `server/livereload.go:10-34` — Live reload script injection

## Resolution

### Fix Description
Modified the live reload script to wait for `window.onload` event before starting to poll. The `load` event fires after all resources (including images) have finished loading. This ensures:

1. All images are fully loaded before live reload starts
2. First poll captures the current `seq`
3. Any subsequent changes trigger reload safely (images cached)

```javascript
// Before: immediate start
checkForChanges();
console.log('[LiveReload] Connected');

// After: wait for page load
if (document.readyState === 'complete') {
  checkForChanges();
  console.log('[LiveReload] Connected');
} else {
  window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    checkForChanges();
    console.log('[LiveReload] Connected');
  });
}
```

The `document.readyState === 'complete'` check handles the edge case where the script runs after the page is already fully loaded.

### Test Coverage
Manual testing - live reload behavior is browser-dependent and difficult to unit test.
