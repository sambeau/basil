Deferred items from implementation, to be picked up in future work.

## High Priority
| Item | Source | Reason Deferred | Notes |
|------|--------|-----------------|-------|
| Resolve paths relative to config file location | FEAT-002 | Phase 1 scope | Handler/static paths should be relative to config file, not CWD |

## Medium Priority
| Item | Source | Reason Deferred | Notes |
|------|--------|-----------------|-------|
| Form validation/sanitization | FEAT-002 | Needs design | Options: config-based schemas, Parsley-side validation, or sanitization-only. See spec Phase 2 checklist. |

## Low Priority / Nice to Have
| Item | Source | Reason Deferred | Notes |
|------|--------|-----------------|-------|
| Admin interface | FEAT-002 | Premature | Needs auth first, unclear requirements. Built with Parsley when needed. |

## Completed (Archive)
<!-- Move items here when done, with completion date -->
