feat(schema): add readOnly constraint and change enum syntax to brackets

- Change enum syntax from enum("a", "b") to enum["a", "b"]
  - Enables future type constraints: enum["a", "b"](serverOnly)
  - Parser now handles enum values in square brackets
  - Type options now support bare boolean flags: string(required)

- Implement readOnly constraint (SPEC-READONLY-001 through -004)
  - Fields marked readOnly are filtered during record creation
  - Fields marked readOnly are filtered during record.update()
  - readOnly fields remain readable via normal property access
  - Schema-level enforcement enables multi-schema pattern

- Implement auto constraint (SPEC-AUTO-001 through -005)
  - Auto fields skipped during validation
  - Auto fields immutable on update (error if changed)
  - auto and required cannot be combined (error)
  - auto and default may be combined

- Add comprehensive tests for auto and readOnly constraints
- Update all documentation and examples for new enum syntax
